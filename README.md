# buttonservice [in development]
A service integrated in [bunch-linux](https://github.com/waelkarman/bunch-linux-manifests) project.<br>
To improve the performance and avoid the overhead introduced by the pooling operation this service will be redesigned by introducing an interrupt to handle the button.
